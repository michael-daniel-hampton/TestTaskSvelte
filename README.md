# TestTaskSvelte
 
The task is to build an interface using the first free online API I found while googling: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
The frontend should simply have a route /posts/<id> that displays a posts and its comments based on this id. Non-existing post ids should be handled gracefully.

You can use the framework of your choice (or no framework), but ideally it is in Svelte since we currently use that.

The task is intentionally simple, as we are more interested in the coding style and quality of the interface.
